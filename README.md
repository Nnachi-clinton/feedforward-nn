"# feedforward-nn"

A feedforward neural network, also known as a multilayer perceptron (MLP), is a type of artificial neural network where connections between the units do not form a cycle. It consists of an input layer, one or more hidden layers, and an output layer. Each layer is composed of units called neurons or nodes. In a feedforward neural network, information moves in only one direction, from the input nodes through the hidden nodes (if any) to the output nodes.
